All main menu buttons lead to the same gamemode, to change gamemode you have to set it in Galaga.cpp in the Load function.
Only singleplayer and multiplayer work.
Enemies also don't have all the expected functionality.

Not all engine requirements are met.
Level layout/setup is not read from a file.
The State pattern has not been implemented.
The Event Queue pattern has been implemented in the engine but not used in the game.

I tried as best as I could to make this engine into something functional, and although I feel like I understand what what I am doing when I take my time.
As you can probably tell by my git, working from home really isn't my strong suit.
